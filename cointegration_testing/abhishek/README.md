## Johannsen Test of Cointegration
The Johannsen test, like other tests of cointegration, is based off the covariance matrix of two time series. This test specifically looks at the rank of the matrix. 

### Pros
- It is the best cointegration test for larger sets of data. For example, if we were to expand past pairs trading and look into triplets, this would be one of the better tests of cointegraiton.

### Cons
- It is not as robust as Engle-Granger in the two variable case.

### Eigenvalue Test
- Looks at the eigenvalues of the matrix and determines cointegration

### Trace Test
- Looks at the trace or sum of eigenvalues
